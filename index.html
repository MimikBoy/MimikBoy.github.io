        <h1>Hi all</h1>
        <p>
            Im going to use this website as an oportunity to learn about web development and reintroduce myself to HTML, 
            CSS and JavaScript. I really just want to make a main page that looks good, in a style I like and then add a game
            as well. Maybe if I get good enough I could figure out how to put all of my projects on here eventually.
